# Project | Py Me Up, Charlie

## PyBank

* In this challenge, a Python script is created for analyzing the financial records of a company. Utilized a data set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script prints both the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, the task it to help with a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 

* Set of poll data used is called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* In addition, the final script prints both the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## Considerations

* Knowledge use of import modules like `csv`; to read and write files in various formats; to store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; to iterate through basic data structures; and to debug along the way. Using this knowledge set, tasks are broken down into discrete mini-objectives. 

* The datasets are quite large and it showcases one of the limits of Excel-based analysis. While our first instinct, as data analysts, is often to head straight into Excel, creating scripts in Python can provide us with more robust options for handling "big data".
